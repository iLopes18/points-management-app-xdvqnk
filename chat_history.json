[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Points Management App \u2013 Functional Description\r\n\r\nThis is a private, two-user points management application designed to track tasks, assign points, and redeem rewards. The app is fully responsive, working seamlessly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers, with a clean, modern interface.\r\n\r\nLayout and Interface:\r\n\r\nHeader: Fixed at the top, displaying total points prominently with a highlighted background for immediate visibility.\r\n\r\nTabs Navigation: Fixed at the bottom with two tabs: \u201cCategories\u201d and \u201cRewards.\u201d The active tab is visually highlighted.\r\n\r\nContent Area: Main scrollable area between header and tabs. Uses a responsive grid layout with two columns on larger screens and one column on narrow screens. Cards have rounded corners, shadows, and subtle hover animations.\r\n\r\nTask Categories and Tasks:\r\n\r\nCategory Cards: Display the category name. Clicking opens the category to show tasks in individual cards.\r\n\r\nTask Cards: Each shows the task name. Two large, color-coded buttons indicate points for each user (pink for Lara, blue for Isaac). Clicking a button adds points for that user and updates the header instantly.\r\n\r\nRewards:\r\n\r\nDisplayed in the same responsive grid. Each reward card shows the reward name, points required, and a large green \u201cRedeem\u201d button. Clicking deducts points and confirms redemption.\r\n\r\nVisual Design and Responsiveness:\r\n\r\nGenerous fonts, button sizes, and spacing for readability on all devices.\r\n\r\nCards and buttons have consistent styling: white backgrounds, rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects.\r\n\r\nGrid adapts automatically to screen size: two cards per row on tablets/desktop, one per row on narrow screens.\r\n\r\nColor palette uses contrast for clarity: bright action buttons, light background, and highlighted tabs.\r\n\r\nInteractive Features:\r\n\r\nPoints update in real time when tasks are completed or rewards redeemed.\r\n\r\nImmediate feedback alerts confirm actions.\r\n\r\nTwo-user tracking ensures fair and transparent points management.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis app allows two users to manage tasks, earn points, and redeem rewards efficiently. Its responsive grid layout, large interactive buttons, dynamic points display, and clear visual hierarchy make it intuitive and enjoyable to use on any device, from smartphones to desktops."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
